# Car Price Analysis

**Repository:** `Car_Price_Analysis_FinalA.ipynb` — exploratory data analysis and modeling for used car price prediction.

## Project Overview
This notebook performs EDA, feature engineering, visualization, and machine learning to predict car prices. It walks through data cleaning, exploratory plots, correlation analysis, multiple regression models (including Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression), model evaluation (MSE, RMSE, R²), and interpretation of results.

## Files
- `Car_Price_Analysis_FinalA.ipynb` — main notebook (analysis, visualizations, model training & evaluation)
- `README.md` — this file

## Dataset
Describe the dataset used (replace with actual details from the notebook):
- Source: *add dataset source or link*
- Main columns: `price`, `year`, `km_driven`, `fuel_type`, `seller_type`, `transmission`, `mileage`, `engine`, `max_power`, `seats`, etc.
- Notes: missing values handling, types converted, and outliers removed as performed in the notebook.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   # or
   jupyter notebook Car_Price_Analysis_FinalA.ipynb
   ```

## Dependencies
Common packages used in the notebook (create `requirements.txt` accordingly):
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- scipy
- jupyter

## Key Steps & Findings
1. **Data cleaning** — handled missing values, converted units (e.g., horsepower, mileage) to numeric, removed outliers for `price` and `km_driven`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** — visualized distributions, relationships (scatter, boxplots), and categorical breakdowns (fuel type, transmission).
3. **Feature Engineering** — transformed/encoded categorical variables, created `age` from `year`, scaled numeric features when needed.
4. **Modeling** — compared multiple models:
   - Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
   - Polynomial Regression (degree 2 or 3)
   - (If present) other regressors such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting
5. **Evaluation** — used MSE, RMSE, and R². The notebook concludes MLR performed best based on lower MSE and higher R² compared to polynomial fit (see notebook for exact metrics).

## Suggestions & Improvements
- Add `requirements.txt` and (optionally) `environment.yml` for reproducibility.
- Move repeated data-processing steps into functions or a preprocessing script (`src/preprocessing.py`).
- Use `sklearn.pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` to make preprocessing + modeling reproducible and less error-prone.
- Add cross-validation (K-Fold) and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV) for robust evaluation.
- Consider tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and compare with linear models; evaluate feature importances.
- Log experiment results (e.g., MLflow or simple CSV) and save the final model with `joblib` or `pickle`.
- Improve notebook readability: add section headers, reduce long code cells, and add short conclusions after each major block.
